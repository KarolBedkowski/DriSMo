    <string name="aboutTxt1">\nDriSMo was created as a bachelor project at Gjøvik University College in 2011.
                             It started out as a fun idea of determining driving skills, to end discussions about
                             who is the best driver. Since then the idea has evolved, and our application is not only
                             taking skills into consideration.\n\nDriSMo will measure the driving quality, and will
                             therefore also take the quality of the road and your car into the equation.</string>

    <string name="autoReplyInfoTxt">DriSMo lets you preset a custom message, which will be sent as an automatic reply
                                    to incoming calls and/or messages. \n\nNote: The message is only
                                    sent one time per recipient. However, if you change the message during runtime,
                                    the new message will be sent one time as well.\n\nStandard text message

    <string name="tutorialContent0_1">Thank you\nfor downloading </string>
    <string name="tutorialContent0_2">the driving quality monitor.</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent0_3">Browse through this short tutorial to learn how to use our application.</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent1_1">First, some general advice: </string>
    <string name="tutorialContent1_2">We recommend having your device connected to a charger while using the
                                      application, especially on long trips, as it requires relatively much battery
                                      power.\n\nIt is also a good idea to remember to enable 3G on your device before
                                      you start driving, if you are planning on using our map service.\n\nTo get
                                      accurate results, you should avoid calibrating the device when you\'re
                                      in a slope.</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent2_1">Quick Action Menu</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent2_2">By pressing and holding an archive list item, you reveal the quick action
                                      menu. This enables you to do simple tasks such as renaming or deleting trip files,
                                      but also has some features to connect with external environment.</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent2_3">When sharing the trip to Facebook, you post a short trip summary to your wall.
                                      This also includes where you started and ended your trip, if such data
                                      is available.\n\nThe export option can send the .csv-file to another application
                                      on your device, so you may do your own analysis of the collected data.</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent3_1">Share To Facebook</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent3_2">When you\'re viewing your trip, you have access to both a graph and a map that
                                      visualizes the quality of the drive. If you press the device menu button
                                      when watching one of those screens, you can share it to Facebook.\n\nWe use the
                                      \"what you see is what you get\" principle here. This means that a replica
                                      of your screen will be uploaded to your Facebook profile, along with a short text
                                      summary of the trip. So, make sure to adjust your map as you would like it to be
                                      displayed, before you hit the Facebook button.</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent4_1">Quality</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent4_2">The quality of driving is based on three factors;
                                      The driver, the vechicle and the environment\n\nIf
                                      two drivers want to compare skills, they can do so by
                                      removing 2 of the factors. In other words, use the same car
                                      in the same environment.</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent5_1">Views</string>
    <string name="tutorialContent5_2">Before (or while) monitoring, you can change the monitor view.
                                      You can also set your favorite in the application settings.
